# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify waste into categories:
- ♻️ Recyclable  
- 🚯 Non-Recyclable  
- ☣️ Hazardous  
- 🌱 Organic  

The goal is to support **smart waste management and recycling** by automating the segregation of garbage using Deep Learning.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Categories: 4 (Recyclable, Non-Recyclable, Hazardous, Organic).  
- Preprocessing: Images resized and normalized before training.

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The CNN model includes:
- Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)  
- MaxPooling Layers  
- Flatten Layer  
- Fully Connected Dense Layers  
- Softmax output for multi-class classification  

Frameworks: **TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib**
